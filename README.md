Food Storage System — Stack & Queue Implementation
This Java project simulates a food tray storage system using three classic data structures: Stack, Linear Queue, and Circular Queue. Each structure models a different way of organizing trays in a kitchen, helping chefs manage food efficiently.

Project Overview
StackStorage: Implements LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) logic — ideal for vertical tray stacking.
QueueStorage: Implements FIFO (First-In-First-Out) logic using a linear array — simple but space-limited.
CircularQueueStorage: Implements FIFO with circular logic — reuses space efficiently using modular arithmetic.
Each storage type supports:

Adding trays (addItem)
Removing trays (removeItem)
Peeking at the next tray (peekItem)
Displaying all trays with index and details (displayItem)
Checking if the storage is full or empty
Learning Goals
This project was built to reinforce:

Manual implementation of stack and queue logic
Understanding circular array behavior
Interface usage and polymorphism in Java
Debugging scope, logic, and indexing errors
Clean, readable output formatting for console applications

SAMLE OUTPUT
Food Tray Details: Index [3] Name : pizza Weight : 300g Best Before : 2025-10-14 Time Placed : 2025-09-30 Valid Tray : true
